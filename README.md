#About
Neuron is a Python project that allows an application's GUI to be built with HTML and Javascript.
It's simply a sample project that is ready to be downloaded and modified to fit your application.

#Variations
The Neuron repo will be structured to allow different variations of the project. Right now the first variation uses cefpython, pyGTK, and Flask. One day there may be a variation that uses wxPython and/or Bottle. I want the project to support variations since Neuron is just a sample project for creating GUIs with web technologies.
### Current Variations
cefpython_pygtk_flask

#Getting Started
The first thing to know is that Neuron is just a sample project. You download the variation that you want and start modifying the project. It is immediately ready to run on download.  
Open one of the project directories in this repo and read the README to get started.
